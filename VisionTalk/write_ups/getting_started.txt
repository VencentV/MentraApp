Get your app running
Install bun
Choose an example app template based on your smart glasses type from our Example Apps page. For this quickstart, we’ll use the Live Captions example:

Copy

Ask AI
gh repo create --template Mentra-Community/MentraOS-Cloud-Example-App
Create repo from template
Note: See our Example Apps page for other examples, including camera-based apps for non-HUD glasses and more advanced examples with additional features.
Clone your new repo locally:

Copy

Ask AI
git clone <your-repo-url>
Navigate to your repo directory and install dependencies:

Copy

Ask AI
cd <your-repo-name>
bun install
Set up your environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory by copying the example:

Copy

Ask AI
cp .env.example .env
Edit the .env file with your app details:

Copy

Ask AI
PORT=3000
PACKAGE_NAME=com.yourName.yourAppName
MENTRAOS_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_console
Make sure the PACKAGE_NAME matches what you registered in the MentraOS Console
Get your API_KEY from the MentraOS Developer Console
Run your app:

Copy

Ask AI
bun run dev
Expose your app to the internet with ngrok:

Copy

Ask AI
ngrok http --url=<YOUR_NGROK_URL_HERE> 3000
Note: 3000 is the port. It must match what is in the app config. If you changed it to 8080, use 8080 for ngrok instead.
IMPORTANT: After making changes to your app code or restarting your server, you must restart your app inside the MentraOS phone app.
